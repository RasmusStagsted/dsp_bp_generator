# dsp_bp_generator (Work in progress)

## Dyson Sphere Program blueprint generator

This is a small project to generate blueprint to the game Dyson Sphere Program (DSP).
The project is inspired from dspbptk, from where the MD5 implementation and the DysonSphereItem enum is taken.

In the beginning, the project aimed to be a tool only to generate a production factory of a user defined item. But since then, it have evolved to be a more generic implementation of a library, to generate and connect various buildings. This is due to the complexity of the way the blue print is encoded.

## Blueprint encoding

A blueprint in Dyson Sphere Program is a list of binary data blobs, each representing a building.

This protocol is also derived from dspbptk.

</td></tr> </table>

All these field is used to specify settings for each single object. The simple ones are for instance the postions (some buildings have two positions such as Sorters), but more complex ones are the indicies, which can be linked together to specify for instance a connection between two Belts, or a connection from a Sorter to an Arc Smelter.
Small helper functions to handle all these settings for each building type have growned into a small library of tools to generate generic blueprints.

Before this big datablob, represnting a list of buildings, is a couple of headers.

This whole data blob is fannaly compressed using gzip and base64 encoded.

### Bluepring structure

For now only the most basic features is implemented.
Generate and connects:
 - Belts
 - Smelters
 - Sorters
 - Assemblers
 - Splitters
 - Power poles

Forthermore, functionality to generate a production bus for an specific item at a user defined rate is implemented. However, only smelters and assemblers are supported. Which means no support for oil refinaries, chemical plants, etc.

## How to use

Run generate_blueprint.py using python3

### Dependencies
???
TODO: create requirement.txt

## Limitations:
 - Do only support one recipe per item
 - Does only support smelter- and assembler factories
 - Does only support single output recipies
 - Does not (fully) support prolifirator (Mk.I, Mk.II, Mk.III)
 - Assumes all sorters and belts lives up to the requirements of throughput
 - Does not support multiple belts of same item
 - Does not support different tiers of sorters, factories nor belts
 - Documentation...
