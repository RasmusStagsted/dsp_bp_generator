# dsp_bp_generator (Work in progress)

This is a small python package to generate blueprint to the game Dyson Sphere Program (DSP).
The project is inspired from the awesome work put into [dspbptk](https://github.com/johndoe31415/dspbptk), from where the MD5 implementation and the DysonSphereItem enum is taken.

In the beginning, the project aimed to be a tool only to generate a production factory of a user defined item. But due to the complexity of the way the blue print is encoded, phe project have evolved to be a more generic implementation of a blueprint library, to generate and connect various buildings.

## How to use

A few small examples show how to run the parser and the serializer of blueprints. As well as a small example of how to generate blueprints from scratch:

(tested using Python 3.8.10)

Install this python package from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/dsp_bp_generator/):
```
pip install dsp_bp_generator
```

### Try the examples

To run the blueprint parser, save your blueprint in a file, and run (obs. the blueprint parser only work with older blueprint versions): 
```

python parse.py --input_file=bp_input.txt --output_file=bp_output_data.txt
```

To run the blueprint parser- editer & serializer, save your blueprint in a file, and run:
```
python parse_edit_and_serialize.py --input_file=bp_input.txt --output_file=bp_output.txt
```

To generate and serialize a blueprint, try running:
```
python generate_and_serialize.py --output_file=bp_output.txt
```

### Development

To develop on this project, clone the repo and generate a virtual invironment using poetry:
```
poetry shell
```

Install requirements:
```
poetry install
```

## Blueprint encoding

A blueprint in Dyson Sphere Program is a list of binary data blobs, each representing a building (this protocol is derived from the awsome work done in [dspbptk](https://github.com/johndoe31415/dspbptk)), with a few headers prepended.

This project utilizes an old protocol of blueprints. This is not the same version as the one exported from the current version of Dyson Sphere Program. But the old blueprint version can be imported into the current game version.

</td></tr> </table>

All these field is used to specify settings for each single object. The simple ones are for instance the postions (some buildings have two positions such as Sorters), but more complex ones are the indicies, which can be linked together to specify for instance a connection between two Belts, or a connection from a Sorter to an Arc Smelter.
Small helper functions to handle all these settings for each building type have growned into a small library of tools to generate generic blueprints.

Before this big datablob, represnting a list of buildings, is a couple of headers.

This whole data blob is finnaly compressed using gzip and then base64 encoded.
Furthermore a fixed string is prepended, and a hash is appended.

### Blueprint version 2

Not supported!

### Blueprint structure

For now only the most basic features is implemented.
Generate and connects:
 - Belts
 - Smelters
 - Sorters
 - Assemblers
 - Splitters
 - Power poles

Forthermore, functionality to generate a production bus for an specific item at a user defined rate is implemented. However, only smelters and assemblers are supported. Which means no support for oil refinaries, chemical plants, etc.

![alt text](https://github.com/RasmusStagsted/dsp_bp_generator/blob/main/screenshot.png?raw=true)
The factory above is generated by dsp_bp_generator

## Limitations:
 - Do only support one recipe per item
 - Does only support smelter- and assembler factories
 - Does only support single output recipies
 - Does not (fully) support prolifirator (Mk.I, Mk.II, Mk.III)
 - Assumes all sorters and belts lives up to the requirements of throughput
 - Does not support multiple belts of same item
 - Does not support different tiers of sorters, factories nor belts
 - Documentation...
